Package: IDIFF
--------------
Improve DIFFractograms = improve quality of 2D diffraction patterns.

* idiff.bcorr  = background correction/subtraction
* idiff.ncorr  = noise correction/reduction 
* idiff.deconv = advanced deconvolution methods (beyond RL-deconvolution)
* idiff.psf    = advanced methods of estimating PSF = point spread function
